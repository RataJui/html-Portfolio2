<h1>The Best Movies According to Jui</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-times</h2>

<hr/>

<h3>JuJutsu Kaisen 0</h3>
<p>The main character is very cool and badass.</p>

<h3>Wish dragon</h3>
<p>The dragon in the movie is very cute and fluffy but he is very annoying.</p>

<h3>Lift</h3>
<p>The movie is very interesting and exciting because the movie is about robbing.<br/>
So people in movie have to plan before robbing and the plan is very creative.
